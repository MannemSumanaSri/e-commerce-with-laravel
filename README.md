E-commerce Website Frontend with Conceptual Laravel Backend
This project is a comprehensive work sample for an e-commerce website, designed to demonstrate a full-stack understanding with a Laravel-like structure. It is inspired by the design and user experience of modern furniture platforms like Nilkamal Furniture.

Project Overview:
The submission comprises two main parts:

A fully functional and responsive frontend: This is built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a complete interactive user experience, simulating various e-commerce functionalities.

Conceptual Laravel backend code: This includes the core PHP files (migrations, models, controllers, and API routes) that would typically power such a frontend in a real Laravel application. This demonstrates an understanding of Laravel's architecture and backend logic.

Part 1: Frontend Demonstration (index.html)
This index.html file is a self-contained frontend work sample. All backend functionalities (user authentication persistence, actual product/cart/order storage, and payment processing) are simulated using client-side JavaScript with mock data.

Key Frontend Features:
Fully Responsive Design: Adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) using Tailwind CSS.

Multi-Language Support: A functional language switcher allows users to toggle between English and Hindi for key text elements.

Dynamic Product Display: Features a "Shop" section that dynamically renders product cards, simulating data fetched from a backend API.

Simulated User Authentication:

Login/Register Modal: Allows "users" to log in (demo credentials: test@example.com / password) or "register" with mock accounts.

User Status: Updates the header to show "Guest" or the simulated logged-in user's name.

Logout Functionality.

Interactive Shopping Cart:

Cart Modal: Clicking the cart icon opens a modal displaying added items.

Add to Cart: Products can be added to the simulated cart.

Quantity Management: Increment or decrement item quantities directly in the cart.

Remove Item: Remove individual products from the cart.

Clear Cart: Empty the entire shopping cart.

Dynamic Cart Count: The cart icon updates to show the total number of items.

Multi-Step Simulated Checkout Flow:

Shipping Information: Collects a mock shipping address.

Simulated Payment Gateway: A dedicated step for "payment" that clearly indicates it's a demonstration and no actual transactions occur.

Order Summary: Displays a summary of the order before final placement.

Place Order: Simulates sending order details to a backend, clearing the cart, and adding the order to the user's "My Orders" history.

Simulated "My Orders" Section: For logged-in users, a modal displays their historical "orders" (from the current session's simulation).

Informative Message Box: Provides clear user feedback for all interactions (e.g., "Product added to cart!", "Login successful!").

Modular JavaScript: Code is organized to manage UI interactions, data simulation, and feature-specific logic.

Frontend Technologies Used:
HTML5: For semantic document structure.

Tailwind CSS: For rapid and responsive styling.

JavaScript (ES6+): For all interactive and simulated functionalities.

How to View the Frontend Demo:
Download/Clone: Obtain the project files (e.g., by downloading the zip or cloning the repository).

Open index.html: Simply open the index.html file in any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

No server setup is required for this frontend demonstration.

Part 2: Conceptual Laravel Backend Code
This section contains the core PHP files that represent the backend structure and logic for the e-commerce application, as requested in the assignment. These files are provided conceptually to demonstrate understanding of Laravel's architecture and backend development.

Note: These files are for review of code structure and logic. A full Laravel development environment (PHP, Composer, database configuration, web server) would be required to run this backend live.

Backend Technologies (Conceptual):
Laravel (PHP Framework): Demonstrates MVC architecture, Eloquent ORM, routing, validation, and API development principles.

MySQL/SQLite (Database Schema): Migrations define the database structure.

Laravel Sanctum: For API authentication (token generation and management).

Conceptual Backend File Structure:
The backend code is organized in a subfolder (e.g., laravel_backend_conceptual_code) mirroring a standard Laravel project structure:
